## 3. Gap Analysis (Current vs. Target)

| Area                 | Current Status                            | Gap                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance          | Unmeasured; likely high baseline          | Need quantified metrics, performance budget, tooling (Lighthouse CI) |
| Accessibility        | Basic semantic structure; limited testing | Add automated + manual audits, alt text coverage, focus management   |
| SEO                  | Default metadata only                     | Implement dynamic head management, OG images, sitemap, RSS           |
| Content              | Minimal seed posts                        | Build taxonomy, publish core pillars (launch stories, systems, lab)  |
| Visual Identity      | Typography only                           | Develop brand kit, motion language, 3D/illustration direction        |
| Interaction          | Static sections                           | Add micro-interactions, interactive case components, transitions     |
| Internationalization | Single language                           | Introduce locale routing, translation pipeline, localized dates      |
| Conversion           | Email CTA only                            | Build contact form, scheduling link, newsletter modal, analytics     |
| Operations           | Manual review                             | Set up CI, testing suite, content linting, release process           |

## 4. Success Metrics Dashboard (Initial)

- **Engagement:** Avg. session duration ≥ 2m 30s, bounce rate ≤ 40%, scroll depth ≥ 70% on hero.
- **Growth:** Newsletter conversion ≥ 3%, inquiry conversion ≥ 1.5%.
- **Content:** Publish cadence ≥ 2 pieces/month, case studies ≥ 4 annually.
- **Technical:** CLS < 0.1, LCP < 2.2s, TBT < 200ms, a11y automated score ≥ 0.95.

## 5. Prioritized Backlog (Next Steps)

1. **Measurement Setup**
